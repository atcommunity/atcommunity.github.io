                    Ahmedabad Tinkering Community is a part of Tinkering India, an initiative started by Dhruv Saidava, a well-known educator dedicated to community and ecosystem development across India and beyond.</p>

                <p> 
                    Driven by the belief that innovation doesn’t require large setups with expensive machines, Dhruv emphasizes mindset-building at the grassroots level through scalable, hands-on learning ecosystems.</p>

                <p>
                    This community aims to engage children across Ahmedabad by creating micro tinkering ecosystems in apartments, neighborhoods, and local spaces, fostering a culture of creativity, problem-solving, and making. By connecting these dots across the city, Ahmedabad Tinkering Community is paving the way for a more inclusive and accessible maker movement.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through workshops, collaborative projects, and knowledge-sharing sessions, we aim to 
                    empower individuals with the skills needed for the future.
